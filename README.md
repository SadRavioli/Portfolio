# Portfolio
Collection of project both curricular and extra

-- C++ --
> Sort Performance Analysis Toolkit. User can choose a sorting algorithm, along with the size of dataset to sort.
The program will then sort the dataset and get the time taken to do it, before adding that to a table of average times.
> Labelling Application. This was a group project in which I was the Project Manager. The app allows you to upload an image/set of images
that you can then draw labels on. These labels can be saved and reloaded from an annotation file. The GUI was designed using Qt.

-- Unreal Engine --
> Mortus VR. Zombie wave game in VR. Can utilise a variety of both one and two handed melee weapons along with a ranged option, to fight a 
series of zombie waves. Was created using the Unreal Engine blueprint system.

-- Processing --
> Image Editing Application. Can upload, edit and then save a copy of an image. Can change brightness/hue/saturation/contrast, and also allows 
the user to draw shapes on the image. User can also choose to apply a filter to the image.

-- Python --
> Python Quiz. This was a first year project done while getting to grips with Python. Implemented PyGame allowing for a GUI alongside
background music and a leaderboard.

> Python Chatbot. Multiple stages to this project. The 1st implements rule-based and similarity-based components to the chatbot,
featuring a bag-of-words model. The 2nd uses a model created by a CNN trained on a dataset that can then be used to predict the class
of new images. Couldn't add the model required to use the chatbot as bigger than 25MB.
